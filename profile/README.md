## 🧭 Overview — What This Mod Menu Truly Is

This is not a blunt cheat panel.
It is a **modular command layer**, injected only while the game lives, touching memory — never files, never saves.

**Core philosophy:**

* Reduce frustration, preserve intensity
* Offer clarity in overwhelming battles
* Allow instant control, instant reversal

Think of it as a tactical console, not a shortcut.

## 🎯 Combat Modules — Precision Under Pressure

Every shot counts.
Every mistake is explosive.

The combat section focuses on *control*, not invincibility.

**Combat features include:**

* Adjustable damage multipliers 🎯
* Infinite or scaled stamina
* No reload / infinite ammo toggles
* God mode (optional, isolated)
* Friendly-fire override for private play

Each option is slider-based, allowing subtle tuning instead of reckless domination.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Combat modules can be enabled per mission and disabled instantly to restore vanilla balance.
